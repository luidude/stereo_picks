# Lu's Stereo Picks

# All in one:
* When space and clutter needs to be kept at a minimum. Lots of brands now have All-in-one systems now. Millennials and GenZ don't like to tinker and plug wires in...
* This also gives the flexibility to add a record player if also get the "vinyl" bug.
* These are not surround sound AV systems. You can hook up a TV and get good stereo sound. Will be 100% better than any soundbar.
* You can also add subwoofer if necessary.

### Good: Klipsch The Fives Powered Speaker System 
* Amazon has them 50% off at the moment.

### Better: Klipsch The Nines Powered Speaker System ( May be my next purchase to replace living room system. ) Otherwise will get Yamaha traditional separates.

### Streamer is needed to play music with airplay or spotify (also an old Apple TV can do the same for Airplay... )

# Traditional separate components and speakers:
* This is the bottom of what the Hifi world considers 'Hifi'. Just saying you have a Yamaha reciever says your serious about what you put into your ears.
* This also gives the flexibility to add a record player if also get the "vinyl" bug.
* These are not surround sound AV systems. You can hook up a TV and get decent stereo sound. Will be 100% better than any soundbar.
* These are "bookshelf" size speakers. "Towers" and "floor standing" speakers are a whole other rabbit hole I refuse to fall into.
* From here the jump to next level involves $1K+ receivers and speakers. It's a game of diminishing returns. Our old ears probably wouldn't tell the difference.

# Micro "chifi" system: Is what I have for a desktop setup.
* Components are in the $100 to $200 range. Swapping them in and out not a big deal. 
* Lots of cables, boxes and tinkering. 
* No remote. Purely for "near field" enjoyment during work hours. 

### Pure Amp:
